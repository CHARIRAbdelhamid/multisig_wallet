🛡️ MultiSig712Optimized

A modern, minimal yet robust multisignature wallet that uses EIP-712 typed data signatures for off-chain approvals and executes transactions on-chain only once enough valid signatures are collected.

This saves gas compared to legacy multisigs that require each owner to confirm on-chain, while preserving strong security guarantees.
Owners and the signature threshold can be managed securely through multisig-approved self-calls.

✨ Features

EIP-712 typed data signing
→ Owners sign transactions off-chain, producing replay-protected signatures.

Gas-efficient M-of-N approvals
→ Only one transaction is submitted on-chain, no per-owner confirmations stored.

Nonce-based replay protection
→ Strictly increasing nonce prevents reuse of signatures.

Deterministic signature validation
→ Owners must submit signatures in strictly ascending order by address.

Self-managed governance
→ Add/remove owners and change threshold only via multisig-approved calls to the wallet itself.

Deadline & gas limit controls
→ Transactions can expire after a deadline or forward only a capped amount of gas.

Reentrancy safe
→ Nonce incremented before external calls and nonReentrant guard prevents attacks.
